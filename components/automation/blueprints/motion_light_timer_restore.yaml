blueprint:
  name: Motion Activated Light with Timer and Scene Restore
  description: This automation will use a motion sensor to detect motion and activate a light. When the motion stops, a cooldown timer is started. If the timer reaches zero before additional motion is detected, the light will be restored to the pre-motion state.
